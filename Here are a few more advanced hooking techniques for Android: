Here are a few more advanced hooking techniques for Android:

### Import Hooking

This hooks calls to imported functions by replacing the import address table (IAT).

1. Find the app's IAT, usually called .dynstr and .dynsym.

2. Iterate through it to find the target imported function name. 

3. Get the original function address from the IAT.

4. Override the address in the IAT with your hook function.

Now calls to that imported function will hit your hook instead.

### Inline Hooking

This directly modifies the target function assembly to redirect execution. 

1. Disassemble the target function using disassmbler like Capstone.

2. Insert a jump instruction at the start to your hook function. 

3. Save the original instructions overwritten by the jump.

4. Execute the original instructions in your hook before returning.

This hooks the function by hijacking the first few instructions.

### Trampoline Hooking 

Similar to inline hooking, but instead of overwriting target function instructions, you jmp to a trampoline containing your hook.

1. Create a trampoline function with your hook logic. 

2. Disassemble the target function.

3. Add a jump to the trampoline at the start.

4. Return from trampoline to target function after your hook.

This avoids modifying the target function.

So in summary, import, inline, and trampoline hooking involve directly modifying code dynamically to execute your hooks. They allow very granular control over execution flow.
